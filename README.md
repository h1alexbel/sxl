# SXL - Simpler XML Transformation Language

**Motivation**. [XSLT] is a functional language for [XML] transformations. It
is widely used in [web development][XML-in-Browser], [ETL] pipelines, and even
in language design ([EO-to-Java compiler][EO] is written in XSLT). However, the
complexity of the language is often a barrier for programmers not familiar with
XML. Thats why we created a new language, with the same semantic as XSLT 3.0,
but with a simpler syntax, and more user-friendly tooling.
